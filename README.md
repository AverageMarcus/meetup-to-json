meetup-to-json
=============

~~Inspired by~~ *stolen from* [@benfoxall](https://github.com/benfoxall)'s [lastfm-to-csv](https://github.com/benfoxall/lastfm-to-csv) and modified to get Meetup.com members.

### What does it do?
Goes off to meetup.com, fetches all the info for members of the specified froup and saves to the browsers local storage. You can then download to your machine as a .json file.

### Why JSON?
It's better then csv, no matter what Ben says
